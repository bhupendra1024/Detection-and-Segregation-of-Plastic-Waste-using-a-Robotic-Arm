Abstract— Plastic waste pollution has become one of the most significant environmental 
concerns in recent years. The accumulation of plastic waste has been observed in various 
locations worldwide, leading to environmental damage and health hazards. In this paper, a 
system is proposed for the detection and segregation of plastic waste using a Robotic arm 
manipulator based on YOLOv5 and Raspberry Pi. YOLOv5 is an advanced object detection 
algorithm that can identify plastic waste in images. The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, small-sized 
computer that can be used as the central processing unit for the proposed system. The system 
includes a camera module that captures images of the waste material in real time, and an 
ultrasonic sensor to measure distance of the object. It detects and identifies the plastic waste in 
the image. Then, using the 3-D coordinate values calculated from the data gathered from the 
camera and ultrasonic sensor, plastic waste is separated using a robotic arm by applying 
inverse kinematics, controlled by the Raspberry Pi. The proposed system's performance was 
evaluated using various custom datasets, and the results show that it can effectively detect and 
segregate plastic waste from other types of waste materials.

•Trained and fine-tuned YOLOv5 model to detect and classify plastic waste objects with 90%+
accuracy, resulting in a 50% reduction in false positives and increased operational efficiency.

•Meticulously fine-tuned hyperparameters within YOLOv5 to optimize the detection accuracy,
ensuring a minimal margin of error and improved overall performance by 15%.

•Integration of a Robotic Arm with Raspberry Pi. This enabled us to automate the segregation
process immediately upon the detection of plastic waste, improving both speed and efficiency
